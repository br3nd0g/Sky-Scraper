# Sky-Scraper
The game that I made for Replit's MadeWithReplit hackathon during march 2022, using Kaboom.js. To play the game you click or press space to jump between two buildings.

[Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) is a subset of JavaScript created by Replit which works as a game engine, handling physics and collision all from the code. It renders the game in browser, using HTML.

With this game I was one of the four honourable mentions in the MadeWithReplit hackathon.

## What I learnt
I had never used kaboom before the hackathon, so i taught myself how to use it, and found it rather similar to Unity but instead there is no interface to add collision and scripts to gameobjects, instead doing it all within the code.

I also had never extensively used JavaScript either, so i learnt some basic JavaScript syntax as well.

## Next Steps
As I'm sure you can tell if you take one look at the code, it is extremely
- Messy
- Unreadable
- Large

Therefore I will add commentary to the code in the near future, and i will also spread different things across different JS files, rather than having all functions, variables and both game scenes all in one file.
